# Project Serene: Mental Health
This project was developed during the MIT Blueprint 2021 hackathon.
The goal was to create any project in under 9 hours!

## About
This website aims to be a resource for anyone going through a rough time, even if it was just one bad day. Especially during a time like this, any kind of resource with de-stressing features is greatly in need. We hope our content can cheer people up and help them feel better! This website includes: leaving positive messages for other users to see, mental health advice depending on the user's input, suggestions for hobbies to relax, and where to find help. Built completely from scratch, with no prior experience to React or backend!

### ~ Moment of peace and quiet, with future hope ~
